# About Kiersten Stokes


*I'm dedicated to lifelong learning for myself and for others, to streamlining anything & everything, to growing genuine relationships based in trust, and to infusing humor as often as possible.*

## Quick Facts

- My husband, **Jim**, is a pilot in the US Air Force, and we met in a Linear Algebra course in undergrad
- I graduated **Miami University** (in Oxford, Ohio) with a B.S. in Chemistry 
- I worked for 3 years at **SmithBucklin**, an association management company whose offices were coincidentally located in the former IBM building in downtown Chicago
- I'm currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at **USC**, and I have one more semester remaining before graduation


## Where I'm From

That's a great question. I made a Voronoi diagram to visualize my various homes across the US. A **Voronoi diagram** is a "partitioning of a plane with points into convex polygons such that each polygon contains exactly one generating point and every point in a given polygon is closer to its generating point than to any other." Each point on the map below represents a place I've lived.

In addition to the above, I also lived in Florence, Italy for half a year, where I worked as an event coordinator for local wineries.
